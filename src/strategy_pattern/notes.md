# STRATERGY PATTERN

This Design pattern helps a object to choose from multiple algorithms and behaviours at runtime.

It is based on principle of composition over inheritence. It defines a family of algorithms, encapsultes each one and makes them interchangable at runtime. The core idea behind this to separate the algorithms from core object and delegate the algorithm's behaviour.

Summary of the above para is that this stratergy extracts the behvoiurs from the object into separate classes of their own and can be reused and swapped in and out at runtime
